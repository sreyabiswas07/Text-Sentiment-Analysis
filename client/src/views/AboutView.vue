    <h1>Text Sentiment Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      Text Sentiment analysis is a method to detect polarity (e.g. a positive or
      negative opinion) within the text, whether a whole document, paragraph,
      sentence, or clause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentiment analysis aims to measure the attitude, sentiments, evaluations,
      attitudes, and emotions of a speaker/writer based on the computational
      treatment of subjectivity in a text.

    <p>
      VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is a model used
      for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity
      (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. It is available
      in the NLTK package and can be applied directly to unlabeled text data.
